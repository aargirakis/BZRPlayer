A library to play Commodore 64 music derived from libsidplay2.<br/>
<br/>

Libsidplayfp (and its console frontend sidplayfp) is a fork of sidplay2
born with the aim to improve the quality of emulating the 6581, 8580 chips
and the surrounding C64 system in order to play SID music better.<br/>

STILView (or more precisely, the STIL class written in C++) is intended to be
compiled with the various SID emulators available on many platforms to provide
the capability of showing STIL and BUG information along with the given SID
that is currently being played in the emulator. It requires HVSC v2.6
(post-update #12) or later to function correctly, but it will work with
earlier versions to a limited extent.
