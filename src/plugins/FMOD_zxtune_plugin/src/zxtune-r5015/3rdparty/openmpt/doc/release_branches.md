branching release braches
=========================

 1. adjust buildbot configuration by copying current trunk configuration to a
    new branch configuration and replace `trunk` with the branch version (i.e.
    `127`), remember to also adjust url of nondist externals
 2. add release build configuration to the buildbot branch configuration file,
    adjust buildbot config of release build configurations to output to the
    separate auto-release directory and change the archive format from 7z to zip
    for windows binaries
 3. branch the nondist externals repository
 4. branch the current trunk HEAD (`$VER` is the branch version):
    `svn copy -m "branch OpenMPT-$VER" https://source.openmpt.org/svn/openmpt/trunk/OpenMPT https://source.openmpt.org/svn/openmpt/branches/OpenMPT-$VER`
 5. update versions in trunk
    `https://source.openmpt.org/svn/openmpt/trunk/OpenMPT`:
     1. set OpenMPT version in `common/versionNumber.h` to
        `1.$(($VER + 1)).00.01`
     2. run `build/update_libopenmpt_version.sh bumpminor`
     3. run `build/update_libopenmpt_version.sh bumpltabi`
 6. update versions in branch
    `https://source.openmpt.org/svn/openmpt/branches/OpenMPT-$VER`:
     1. set OpenMPT version in `common/versionNumber.h` to
        `1.$VER.00.$MINORMINOR+1`
     2. run `build/update_libopenmpt_version.sh bumpprerel`
