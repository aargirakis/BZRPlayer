Java midlet
~~~~~~~~~~~

Midlet is an application for mobile phones.
The ASAP midlet requires CLDC 1.1 and MIDP 2.0
and thus will not work on very old Java implementations.
The midlet has a file browser for selecting music files,
which should be stored in phone memory or on a memory card.
J2ME platforms usually start playback after the music is completely rendered.
