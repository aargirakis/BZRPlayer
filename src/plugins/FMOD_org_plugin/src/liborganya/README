===============

 A simple library for decoding Cave Story's org music files.

Usage
-----

 To instantiate a decoder:
   org_decoder_t *decoder = org_decoder_create("path/to/file.org", "samples");

 The first argument is the path to the org file. The second argument is the
 path to a directory that contains the data files that are included in the
 samples directory.

 To decode samples:
   org_decode_samples(decoder, buffer, num_samples);

 The output is 2 channel interleaved signed 16-bit host endian PCM data with
 a 44100 sample rate. It returns the number of samples actually decoded.

 When  you are finished:
   org_decoder_destroy(decoder);

 See orgyana.h for additional functions and details.

Notes
-----
 The org file format description can be found at
 http://cavestory-stuff.org/Info/orgfilesdesc.txt.
 
 The org2dat folder contains the source to a simple command line utility that
 uses liborganya to decode files to raw PCM data.

 The component folder contains source to a CoreAudio AudioFile component. 

Thanks
------
 - Pixel for making Cave Story and composing all the songs
 - Moose for providing an overview of the format.
 - Jan "Rrrola" Kadlec and The Echidna Tribe, whose org2xm tool and in_org winamp plugin filled in some additional details where the file format description is inadequate.
 - Boredom for giving me a reason to do this
