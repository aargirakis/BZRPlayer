Introduction
------------

Libxmp is a module player library supporting many mainstream and obscure
module formats including Protracker MOD, Scream Tracker III S3M and
Impulse Tracker IT. Libxmp loads the module and renders the sound as
linear PCM samples in a buffer at rate and format specified by the user,
one frame at a time (standard modules usually play at 50 frames per second).

Possible applications for libxmp include stand-alone module players, module
player plugins for other players, module information extractors, background
music replayers for games and other applications, module-to-mp3 renderers, etc.


Concepts
--------

* **Player context:**
  Most libxmp functions require a handle that identifies the module player
  context. Each context is independent and multiple contexts can be defined
  simultaneously.

* **Sequence:**
  Each group of positions in the order list that loops over itself, also
  known as "subsong". Most modules have only one sequence, but some modules,
  especially modules used in games can have multiple sequences. "Hidden
  patterns" outside the main song are also listed as extra sequences, certain
  module authors such as Skaven commonly place extra patterns at the end of
  the module.


A simple example
----------------

This example loads a module, plays it at 44.1kHz and writes it to a raw
sound file::

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <xmp.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        xmp_context c;
        struct xmp_frame_info mi;
        FILE *f;
    
        /* The output raw file */
        f = fopen("out.raw", "wb");
        if (f == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "can't open output file\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    
        /* Create the player context */
        c = xmp_create_context();
    
        /* Load our module */
        if (xmp_load_module(c, argv[1]) != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "can't load module\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    
        /* Play the module */
        xmp_start_player(c, 44100, 0);
        while (xmp_play_frame(c) == 0) {
            xmp_get_frame_info(c, &mi);
    
            if (mi.loop_count > 0)    /* exit before looping */
                break;
    
            fwrite(mi.buffer, mi.buffer_size, 1, f);  /* write audio data */
        }
        xmp_end_player(c);
        xmp_release_module(c);        /* unload module */
        xmp_free_context(c);          /* destroy the player context */
    
        fclose(f);
    
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }


A player context can load and play a single module at a time. Multiple
contexts can be defined if needed.

Use `xmp_test_module()`_ to check if the file is a valid module and
retrieve the module name and type. Use `xmp_load_module()`_ to load
the module to memory. These two calls return 0 on success or <0 in case of
error. Error codes are::

  -XMP_ERROR_INTERNAL   /* Internal error */
  -XMP_ERROR_FORMAT     /* Unsupported module format */
  -XMP_ERROR_LOAD       /* Error loading file */
  -XMP_ERROR_DEPACK     /* Error depacking file */
  -XMP_ERROR_SYSTEM     /* System error */

If a system error occurs, the specific error is set in ``errno``.

Parameters to `xmp_start_player()`_ are the sampling
rate (up to 48kHz) and a bitmapped integer holding one or more of the
following mixer flags::

  XMP_MIX_8BIT          /* Mix to 8-bit instead of 16 */
  XMP_MIX_UNSIGNED      /* Mix to unsigned samples */
  XMP_MIX_MONO          /* Mix to mono instead of stereo */
  XMP_MIX_NEAREST       /* Mix using nearest neighbor interpolation */
  XMP_MIX_NOFILTER      /* Disable lowpass filter */

After `xmp_start_player()`_ is called, each call to `xmp_play_frame()`_
will render an audio frame. Call `xmp_get_frame_info()`_ to retrieve the
buffer address and size. `xmp_play_frame()`_ returns 0 on success or -1
if replay should stop.

Use `xmp_end_player()`_, `xmp_release_module()`_ and
`xmp_free_context()`_ to release memory and end replay.

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

  Start playing the currently loaded module.
 
  **Parameters:**
    :c: the player context handle.
 
    :rate: the sampling rate to use, in Hz (tipically 44100). Valid values
       range from 8kHz to 48kHz.

    :flags: bitmapped configurable player flags, one or more of the
      following::

        XMP_FORMAT_8BIT         /* Mix to 8-bit instead of 16 */
        XMP_FORMAT_UNSIGNED     /* Mix to unsigned samples */
        XMP_FORMAT_MONO         /* Mix to mono instead of stereo */

  **Returns:**
    0 if sucessful, or a negative error code in case of error.
    Error codes can be ``-XMP_ERROR_INTERNAL`` in case of a internal player
    error, ``-XMP_ERROR_INVALID`` if the sampling rate is invalid, or
    ``-XMP_ERROR_SYSTEM`` in case of a system error (the system error
    code is set in ``errno``).

.. _xmp_play_frame():

int xmp_play_frame(xmp_context c)
`````````````````````````````````

  Play one frame of the module. Modules usually play at 50 frames per second.
  Use `xmp_get_frame_info()`_ to retrieve the buffer containing audio data.
 
  **Parameters:**
    :c: the player context handle.

  **Returns:**
    0 if sucessful or -1 if the module was stopped.

.. _xmp_play_buffer():

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

  *[Added in libxmp 4.1]* Fill the buffer with PCM data up to the specified
  size. This is a convenience function that calls `xmp_play_frame()`_
  internally to fill the user-supplied buffer -- don't call both functions
  in the same replay loop, choose one of them. If you don't need equally
  sized data chunks, `xmp_play_frame()`_ will result in better performance.

  **Parameters:**
    :c: the player context handle.

    :buffer: the buffer to fill with PCM data, or NULL to reset the
     internal state.

    :size: buffer size in bytes.

    :loop: stop replay when the loop counter reaches the specified
     value, or 0 to disable loop checking.

  **Returns:**
    0 if sucessful or -1 if module was stopped or the loop counter was
    reached.

.. _xmp_get_frame_info():

void xmp_get_frame_info(xmp_context c, struct xmp_frame_info \*info)

            struct xmp_channel_info {     /* Current channel information */
                unsigned int period;      /* Sample period */
                unsigned int position;    /* Sample position */
                short pitchbend;          /* Linear bend from base note*/

      This function should be used to retrieve sound buffer data after
      `xmp_play_frame()`_ is called. Fields ``buffer`` and ``buffer_size``
      contain the pointer to the sound buffer PCM data and its size. The

    :val: the value to set. Valid values are:

      * Amplification factor: ranges from 0 to 3. Default value is 1.

      * Stereo mixing: percentual left/right channel separation. Default is 70.

      * Interpolation type: can be one of the following values::

          XMP_INTERP_NEAREST  /* Nearest neighbor */
          XMP_INTERP_LINEAR   /* Linear (default) */
          XMP_INTERP_SPLINE   /* Cubic spline */

          XMP_DSP_LOWPASS     /* Lowpass filter effect */
          XMP_DSP_ALL         /* All effects */

      * Player flags: tweakable player parameters. Valid flags are::

        as above but after applying module-specific quirks (if any).

      * *[Added in libxmp 4.1]* Control sample load. Valid values are::

          XMP_SMPCTL_SKIP     /* Don't load samples */
 
        Disabling sample loading when loading a module allows allows
        computation of module duration without decompressing and
        loading large sample data, and is useful when duration information
        is needed for a module that won't be played immediately.

  **Returns:**
    0 if parameter was correctly set, or ``-XMP_ERROR_INVALID`` if
    parameter or values are out of the valid ranges.
