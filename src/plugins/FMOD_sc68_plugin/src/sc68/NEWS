2003-09-06    <ben@sashipa.com>

	sc68 2.1.0 is about to be released.
	
	First major feature is the SNDH file loader. Only the new unice
	library that is a "C" conversion of the 68000 original source
	makes it possible since most SNDH are ice compressed and the
	previous unice used the 68K emulator.
	
	Second major feature is the gzipped file handle. It is transparent
	for file only. This mean you can either gzip sc68 files or sndh
	files or whatever formats that may be handle in the future (so I
	hope).
	
	A nasty bug has been removed from debug68. The previous version
	was broken !
	
	Added support for memory and file descriptor stream. May be
	usefule for socket loader ...

	unice68 now use the native unice library that has been added to
	this package. It should be about 50 times faster than the old
	emulated version.

	Welcome to sc68 2.0.0 ! This is a new API. It is expected to be
	really more convenient.

	The following subdir has been fired:
	
        - xmms68    Move to a separate package
        - winamp68  Move to a separate package
        - browse68  Deprecated, never used ...
        - sc68app   Old API replaced by api68
        - The dreamcast version has been removed from the project. Dream68
	  is no more but sc68 is always available on Dreamcast as a
	  dcplaya plugin <http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplaya>.
		
	Add-ons and modifications:
	
        - minor modifications of the emulator engine and probably some
	  minor changes and bug fixes.
	
        - emu68debug is the debug version of the emu68 library. This
	  version of the library is able to make some smoop on memory
	  access.  It is used by almost all tools that need a 68k emulator
	  not for performance (including debug68 unice68 sourcer68).
	
	List of program available with this package:
	
        - ``sc68''       Command line player.
        - ``debug68''    sc68 file builder and debugger.
        - ``unice68''    ICE 2.4 depacker.
        - ``sourcer68''  Powerful 68000 disassembler.
        - ``as68''       68000 macro assembler.
        - ``info68''     Prints info about sc68 files in a free format.

	Data and resources:
	
        - The new API handles separate location for shared data and user
	data.
	
        - share data : location depends on install prefix. It should be
	  something like ``$datadir/sc68'' (/usr/local/share/sc68).
	
        - user data : default location is ``$HOME/.sc68''. User may
	  override this value by setting ``SC68_HOME'' environment
	  variable.
	
        - A lot of deprecated field have been removed from config file.

	New API major modifications:
	
        - Memory allocation handler independant.
	
        - Loading and saving file with generic ``virtual''
	  stream. Including by default a implementation of FILE and memory
	  stream.
	
        - Setting shared data path and user data path.
	
        - Really more simple : a lot of work is done by the api68.

	Dream68 - sc68 1.2 for Dreamcast - is about to be released as a
	bootable Dreamcast CD. The dream68 project sources will be include
	in a few time after a necessary cleaning.


2002-01-22    <ben@sashipa.com>

	Release 1.2.0 of sc68 distribution is about to be completed.

	This new version includes a new YM-2149 emulator which is now
	emulate with the maximum precision. This kind of oversampling
	allows to make some dynamic level buzzer to be emulated correctly
	(thanks to Frank Seemann (Tao/Cream)).

	Some more external players has been added including Tao- Big Demo
	SID sound and Tao - TSD SID emulator. Quartet replay has been
	changed from Mindbomd demo version to original "singsong.prg" one.

	Some musics has been added to the sc68 music collection too.
