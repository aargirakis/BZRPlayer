# set PCMSeparateChannels to True or 1 to create 7 output files in total, one for the mixed audio

# set Oversample to a value >=2 to enable multiple passes of higher-resolution internal calculations
# to help remove aliasing. It's not perfect but Oversample=6 should provide mostly-distortion-free results.
# Set to lower values, or 1 (or 0) to disable, to minimize CPU time spent, for lower-powered systems.
#Oversample=6

# set Highpass to True or 1 to enable a small highpass filter (experimental) to remove DC bias,
# which can manifest as pops and clicks when changing speaker volume.
# There is a small computation overhead but it's very small and probably worth enabling anyway.
#Highpass=True

# set Boost to a number > 1 to boost the output volume. set to 1 or lower to disable boost.
# With Boost=1 (boost disabled), the output volume might be quite quiet overall in some cases but it also
# guarantees there will be no output clipping when all sound generators are running at maxmimum volume.
# Enabling boost can cause saturation (clipping distortion) at louder volumes.
# This value accepts decimal values e.g. Boost=1.414
#Boost=1
